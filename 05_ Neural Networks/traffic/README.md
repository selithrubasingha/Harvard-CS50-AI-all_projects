# Project 5: Traffic

## Project Overview

In this project, I built and trained a deep neural network to classify traffic signs. Using a dataset of thousands of images of German traffic signs, the AI learns to recognize and categorize them. This is a classic computer vision problem with direct applications in autonomous driving. ðŸš¦



## Key concepts & Skills Gained

-   **Deep Learning:** Gained hands-on experience building a deep learning model.
-   **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Designed a CNN architecture, which is the industry standard for image classification tasks. This included using convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and dropout for regularization.
-   **Computer Vision:** Tackled a real-world image classification problem.
-   **TensorFlow/Keras:** Used the TensorFlow library to define, compile, train, and evaluate the neural network.
-   **Data Augmentation (Optional but recommended):** Understood how augmenting the training data (e.g., rotating, flipping images) can improve model generalization.

## A Note on Scaffolding

In accordance with the project specifications for Harvard's CS50 AI course, the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset was provided. My task was to implement the `load_data` and `get_model` functions in `traffic.py`. This involved writing the code to load and preprocess the image data and designing the entire neural network architecture.
