# Project 4: Shopping

## Project Overview

This project is a practical application of machine learning for classification. The goal was to build an AI that could predict whether an online shopper would complete a purchase or not, based on a dataset of their session information (e.g., pages visited, time spent, browser type).

## Key Concepts & Skills Gained

-   **Supervised Learning:** Trained a model on a labeled dataset (where the outcome of each session is known) to make predictions on new, unlabeled data.
-   **Classification Models:** Implemented and trained a **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** classifier, a fundamental machine learning algorithm.
-   **Data Preprocessing:** Wrote code to load data from a CSV file and preprocess it, converting categorical data (like month names) into numerical formats suitable for the model.
-   **Model Evaluation:** Split the data into training and testing sets and evaluated the performance of the trained model using metrics like **accuracy**, **sensitivity (true positive rate)**, and **specificity (true negative rate)**.
-   **Machine Learning Libraries:** Gained experience using the popular `scikit-learn` library for machine learning tasks.

## A Note on Scaffolding

In accordance with the project specifications for Harvard's CS50 AI course, the `shopping.csv` dataset was provided. My role was to write the Python script `shopping.py` from scratch to load the data, process it, train a k-NN classifier, and evaluate its performance.
